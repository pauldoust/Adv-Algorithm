The dynamic programming implementation is based on the Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm  proposed in 1962 independently by Bellman[1] and by Held and Karp.
\newline{}
Dynamic programming express a solution for a problem through the solution of smaller problem.
\newline{}
Let's consider a set of node $S=\{0,1,......,n\}$. We want to compute the minimum cost for a path starting at node 0 and visiting all nodes exactly once.


\begin{subsection}{Implementation}
\paragraph{Optimal solution}\hfill \break
Let's consider a set S' $\subseteq$ S and $C(S',j)$ the minimum cost for a path between node 0 and node j containing all nodes from S'. Then the cost $C(S',j)$ can be decomposed in the sum of the minimum cost of the path from node 0 to k including all nodes from $S'-\{j\}$, and the distance $d_{kj}$.

$$C(S',j)=min_{k \in S'-\{j\}, k \ne j}\{C(S',k)+d_{kj}\}$$

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Base case}\hfill \break
If $S'=\{0\}$, $$C(S',0)=0$$.

\paragraph{Implementation trick}\hfill \break
We use a bit field to code the subset of nodes selected in the set \{1,...n\}.
Each node j is code by the value $2^j$ when selected and 0 when not selected.

\begin{subsection}{Complexity}
   We need to build all the subsets of \{1,...,n\} i.e. $2^n$ subsets. For all nodes j of each subset (at most n nodes) and for all nodes k distinct from node j(at most n-1 nodes), we compute the cost of the sub paths terminated by node k for the subset deprived of node j.
Thus the time complexity is $2^n n^2$.
\newline{} In term of space complexity, if we use a bit field to code all subsets for each node $j \subseteq \{0,...,n\}$, the required space is $2^n (n+1)$.
\newline{} Nevertheless, we can note that to compute the cost for the subsets of size s, we only need the cost of the subsets of size (s-1). Thus the space complexity can be reduced to:
$$  max_{1<s<n}((s-1) \binom{n}{s-1} + s\binom{n}{s})$$
which is $O(2^n\sqrt n)$ .
\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection}{Performances}

The DP algorithm is run on a set of problems, symetrix and asymetric, generated randomly with distance between 1 and 1000. 
The algorithm is first run with different graph sizes. Figure ~\ref{fig:dpgraphsize} shows that running time for both types of problem follow the theorical time complexity curve.
The performances are also measured with different sparsity levels. Figure ~\ref{fig:dpgraphsize} shows that the running time does not varies whith the sparsity. It is still necessary to examine all combinations of subsets.

Memory usage is a limitation to running the dynamic programming algorithm. Only the smallest problems of TSLIB could be tested. The optimal solution is obtained each time as seen on Table \ref{table:dpt1}.
